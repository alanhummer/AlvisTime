# Alvis Time - Jira Time Log! August 2021 Edition!

This Chrome Extenison will interface to a Jira instance via REST API's and based on on your recent work activity, build a time-card interface so you can enter all of your time for the week directly into Jira.

There will be a "submit for approval" and "approval" process added  - so manager can see what was submitted and upon approve, and port it to time entry system as they wish

Additionally, background process runs to send alerts if time card not entered, and also notify admin user if there are cards pending approval.
