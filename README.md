# Lands' End Jira Time Log

This Chrome Extenison will interface to LE Jira instance via REST API's and based on on your recent work activity, build a time-card interface so you can enter all of your time for the week directly into Jira.

There will be a "submit for approval" and "approval" process added  - so manager can see what was submitted and upon approve, port it to Service Now.

This will then be ported to Service Now.  Service Now does not have an API, however screen automation tool will be used to do the integration
